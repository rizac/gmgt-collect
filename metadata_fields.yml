# Metadata fields specification. A field is a record property, usually corresponding to
# a column in a tabular representation (e.g. CSV, Dataframe)
# 
# <field_name>:
#   dtype:    The field data type. Supported values are int, float, bool, datetime, or a
#             list of values (all the same dtype) for categorical data, i.e. when the
#             field can only take on one of the given values. Strings of text (`str`) are
#             allowed only as category values (event_id and station_id dtype is`str` but
#             their dtype will eventually be converted to categorical in the code)
#   default:  The default for missing values. float, datetime or categorical fields can
#             represent missing values natively (e.g., NaN or None), while int and bool
#             require an explicit default (e.g., 0 and false)
#   help:     The field description. "[Mandatory]" in the text means that values for this
#             field cannot be missing

# [!] IF YOU ARE BUILDING A SOURCE DATASET TO BE HARMONIZED WITH THIS PACKAGE TOOLS:
# 1. You do not need to provide the following fields (they will auto generated):
#    id, available_components, sampling_rate
# 2. Records with missing values for mandatory fields ("[Mandatory]" see above) can be
#    provided, but they will be discarded from the harmonized dataset
